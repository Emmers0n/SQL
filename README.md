Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project README
===============================================

Introduction
------------

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. The management team of Rockbuster Stealth is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. This project involves analyzing the data of Rockbuster Stealth to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. As a data analyst in the Business Intelligence department of Rockbuster Stealth, you are required to use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

Key Questions and Objectives
----------------------------

The main questions that need to be answered using the data of Rockbuster Stealth are:

-   Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
-   What was the average rental duration for all videos?
-   Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
-   Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
-   Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Context
-------

To answer these questions, you will use SQL to query the data from the PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS). The results of your analysis will be presented to the Rockbuster management team in an easily digestible format.

Data Set
--------

The data set used in this project contains information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The data set is around 3MB and contains several files. The data set needs to be loaded into the PostgreSQL database.

Project Deliverables
--------------------

At the end of each exercise, you will complete a task and submit a deliverable that contributes to the final project analysis. You will receive feedback on your deliverables from your tutor. Your final project, which you will submit at the end of Exercise 10, will be reviewed by your mentor, who will also provide feedback on your work.

Final Analysis Criteria
-----------------------

Your final project will be evaluated based on your ability to:

-   Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
-   Present your SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling a compelling story.
-   Present your SQL results to your technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a data dictionary.
-   Create a professional project that you can add to your portfolio and show to employers.

--------------

In this project, you will learn:

-   The difference between relational databases and non-relational databases.
-   The importance of online analytical processing databases (OLAP) and relational database management systems (RDBMS).
-   Data storage structures, including keys and indexes.
